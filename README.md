# thearena.show

Canonical source for **The Arena — Business Services Trade Show in Dubai**.
The current site release is `v6.08`.

The application uses Next.js and React, is compiled by
[vinext](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext), and runs as a Cloudflare Worker
with static assets.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.13.0`

## Quick Start

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Use Node.js `22.13.0` or newer. The pinned version is also recorded in `.nvmrc`.

## Project structure

- `app/` — page components and styles
- `public/` — production images, video and static pages
- `worker/` — Cloudflare Worker entry point and API handlers
- `tests/` — server-rendered v6.08 contract tests
- `.github/workflows/` — CI and isolated preview deployment
- `.openai/hosting.json` — legacy Sites project association

## Workspace Auth Headers

OpenAI workspace sites can read the current user's email from
`oai-authenticated-user-email`.

SIWC-authenticated workspace sites may also receive
`oai-authenticated-user-full-name` when the user's SIWC profile has a non-empty
`name` claim. The full-name value is percent-encoded UTF-8 and is accompanied by
`oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding: percent-encoded-utf-8`.

Treat the full name as optional and fall back to email when it is absent:

```tsx
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  const requestHeaders = await headers();
  const email = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-email");
  const encodedFullName = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name");
  const fullName =
    encodedFullName &&
    requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding") ===
      "percent-encoded-utf-8"
      ? decodeURIComponent(encodedFullName)
      : null;

  const displayName = fullName ?? email;
  // ...
}
```

## Optional Dispatch-Owned ChatGPT Sign-In

Import the ready-to-use helpers from `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` when the site needs
optional or required ChatGPT sign-in:

- Use `getChatGPTUser()` for optional signed-in UI.
- Use `requireChatGPTUser(returnTo)` for server-rendered pages that should send
  anonymous visitors through Sign in with ChatGPT.
- Use `chatGPTSignInPath(returnTo)` and `chatGPTSignOutPath(returnTo)` for
  browser links or actions.
- Pass a same-origin relative `returnTo` path for the destination after sign-in
  or sign-out. The helper validates and safely encodes it.
- Mark protected pages with `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` because
  they depend on per-request identity headers.

Dispatch owns `/signin-with-chatgpt`, `/signout-with-chatgpt`, `/callback`, the
OAuth cookies, and identity header injection. Do not implement app routes for
those reserved paths. Routes that do not import and call the helper remain
anonymous-compatible.

SIWC establishes identity only; it does not prove workspace membership. Use the
Sites hosting platform's access policy controls for workspace-wide restrictions,
or enforce explicit server-side membership or allowlist checks.

Use SIWC for account pages, user-specific dashboards, saved records, and write
actions tied to the current ChatGPT user. Leave public content anonymous.

## Checks

- `npm run build` — create the Cloudflare-compatible vinext build
- `npm test` — build and run the rendered-page contract tests
- `npm run lint` — report ESLint findings
- `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` — audit production dependencies

## Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md). GitHub deploys only to an isolated
Cloudflare preview Worker; production cutover is deliberately separate.
